**Music Box** is a music library implemented with a web UI frontend and backend server built with **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **PostgreSQL**.  
It lets you upload, organize, and play your favorite songs, complete with album metadata details (date release, Artist
Track, etc.). The **Java script** UI will register and login to the server getting a **JWT token**. 
This token is used to list songs for the logged-in user. The user can then upload songs to the Spring server or **AWS** cloud. The user can then play the 
songs they upload, and the song metadata is queried to get the precise artist, album, release date, Track, etc.
